Most of the time in our life we spend on internet now a days because we are getting more and more benifits from it, we will see some of its,

- we can do online shoping
- Book our airline tickes, Bus tickes and Train tickes without going to those places
- Getting news allover the world
- We can transfer money online

what not, we are doing amazing things by using internet just sitting at one place,amazing right. But there are lot of things in the internet world.

We will understand how internet works by using one example, let us take Youtube how this works, Before this we will see some parts in the youtube,

1. Frontend 
2. REST apis
3. Server
4. Database

These are the four pillars of any application to in the internet.when you click on the some video on youtube UI, the rest api takes the request and send to the server if the request is successfull then server search in his respective database and send the required information to the Rest api and that api again bring that response to the UI and display in the browser.

Now we will see discuss on REST one of the crusial part of the this process.
