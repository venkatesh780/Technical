Most of the time in our life we spend on the internet nowadays because we are getting more and more benefits from it, we will see some of its,
- we can do online shopping
- Book our airline tickets, Bus tickets, and Train tickets without going to those places
- Getting news all over the world
- We can transfer money online

whatnot, we are doing amazing things by using the internet just sitting at one place, amazing right. But there are a lot of things in the internet world.
We will understand how the internet works by using one example, let us take Youtube how this works, Before this we will see some parts on the youtube,
1. Frontend
2. REST APIs
3. Server
4. Database

These are the four pillars of any application on the internet. when you click on some video on youtube UI, the rest API takes the request and sends it to the server if the request is successful then the server search in his respective database and send the required information to the Rest API and that API again bring that response to the UI and display in the browser.
Now we will discuss REST one of the crucial parts of this process.
